   Privacy Policy for Weather Nest

Effective Date: April 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Grim Interactive ("Company", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our mobile application Weather Nest (the "App").

1. Information We Collect

To provide our services and display advertisements, we collect or have access to the following types of information:

Precise Location Data (Geolocation):
How we collect it: We request permission to access your device's location services. You provide this data only if you grant the App permission through your device's operating system settings.
Why we collect it: We use your location primarily to provide you with current weather conditions and forecasts relevant to your specific geographic area within the App. As detailed below, this data may also be used by our advertising partner (Google AdMob) to serve relevant ads.
Device and Usage Information (Collected via Third Parties): Our advertising partner (Google AdMob) automatically collects certain information when ads are displayed. This may include:
Device identifiers (such as the Google Advertising ID or IDFA)
IP address
Device make, model, and operating system
Information about your interactions with ads shown in the App.
We do not require you to create an account, register, provide a name, email address, password, or any other directly identifying contact information to use the App.

2. How We Use Your Information

Your information is used for the following purposes:

To Provide Weather Services: Your location data is essential for fetching and displaying weather information (current conditions, forecasts, alerts) for your current location via the National Weather Service API.
To Provide Advertisements: We use Google AdMob to display advertisements within the App, which helps keep the App free. AdMob uses the collected device and usage information (and potentially your location data) to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.
To Improve the App: We may analyze aggregated, non-identifiable usage data to understand how users interact with the App and improve its functionality (though we do not collect analytics data directly unless specified).
Your location data, when used for weather purposes, is processed ephemerally and is not stored long-term by Grim Interactive.

3. Sharing Your Information

We do not sell or rent your personal information. We share data only in the following circumstances:

Weather Service Provider (National Weather Service): To retrieve weather data, we send your geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) to the National Weather Service (NWS) API. The NWS API requires these coordinates to provide weather information for your specific location. We do not send any other personally identifiable information to the NWS API. The NWS's use of this data is governed by their own privacy policies and terms of service.
Advertising Partner (Google AdMob): We use Google AdMob to serve ads in the App. AdMob collects and processes information as described in Section 1 to display ads. This data sharing is necessary for the ad functionality. Google's use of this information is governed by Google's Advertising policies and privacy policies. You can learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use their services here: https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites   
We may also disclose information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).   

4. Data Security

We implement reasonable measures to protect the information accessed or processed by the App. However, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Data transmission is handled using standard protocols.   

5. Advertising and Your Choices

The App displays ads through Google AdMob.

Personalized Advertising: AdMob may use your information (including device identifiers and potentially location) to show you ads that are more relevant to your interests.
Opting Out of Personalized Ads: You can typically limit ad tracking or opt-out of personalized advertising through your mobile device's settings:
iOS: Go to Settings > Privacy > Tracking (ensure "Allow Apps to Request to Track" is off or managed per app) and Settings > Privacy > Apple Advertising > Turn off "Personalized Ads".
Android: Go to Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization (or "Delete advertising ID" on newer versions).
Please note that opting out does not mean you will stop seeing ads; it means the ads you see may be less relevant to you.
6. Your Location Controls

You have control over the collection of your location data:

Location Permissions: You can enable or disable location services for the Weather Nest app at any time through your device's settings. If you disable location services, the App will not be able to provide location-specific weather information, and location-based ad targeting (if used) will also be disabled.
7. Children's Privacy

The Weather Nest app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us.   

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website (if applicable), and we will update the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
