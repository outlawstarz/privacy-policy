    Privacy Policy for Weather Nest

Effective Date: April 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Grim Interactive ("Company", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our mobile application Weather Nest (the "App").

1. Information We Collect

The only personal information we collect through the App is your precise location data (geolocation).

How we collect it: We request permission to access your device's location services. You provide this data only if you grant the App permission through your device's operating system settings.
Why we collect it: We use your location solely to provide you with current weather conditions and forecasts relevant to your specific geographic area within the App.
We do not collect any other personal information. The App does not require you to create an account, register, provide a name, email address, password, or any other contact or identifying information.

2. How We Use Your Information

Your location data is used exclusively for the core functionality of the App:

To fetch and display weather information (current conditions, forecasts, alerts) for your current location.
Your location data is processed ephemerally for this purpose and is not stored long-term by Grim Interactive, nor is it used to personally identify you.

3. Sharing Your Information

We do not sell or rent your location data.

We may share your location data with third-party weather service providers (e.g., weather data APIs) solely for the purpose of retrieving the weather information requested by you through the App. These providers are used only to process your request for weather data based on your location and are expected to handle the data according to their own privacy policies. We do not share location data with any other third parties for advertising or other purposes.

4. Data Security

We implement reasonable measures to protect the location data accessed by the App. However, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Data transmission is handled using standard protocols. Since we do not store your location data or any other personal information, the risks associated with data breaches are minimized.

5. Your Choices and Controls

You have control over the collection of your location data:

Location Permissions: You can enable or disable location services for the Weather Nest app at any time through your device's settings. If you disable location services, the App will not be able to provide location-specific weather information.
6. Children's Privacy

The Weather Nest app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected location data from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information.   

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website (if applicable). You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
